# Administration

In the admin panel you can do every administration that is necessary for the running system.

### Customers

Here you can add, modify and delete customers. If you do not set a password the customer cannot login to Kimai. By selecting a group you enable all members of that group to see that customer. All fields except the customer name are optionally.

### Projects

Here you can add, modify and delete projects. Projects have to be aligned to a customer. Further you can set rates for this project if they differ from the standard rates (for details about rates see chapter [Rates](manual/rates.md)). If there is a budget it can be set here, too.

### Tasks

Here you can add, modify and delete tasks. A task has no relation to a customer or a project, but you can select which groups can use them. Additionally you can set rates here, too (for details about rates see chapter 7.5).

### Users

Here you can add, modify and delete users. A user can only belong to one group at a time. If you enter a valid email address you can send emails from your local account by clicking the mailer symbol.

### Groups

Here you can add, modify and delete groups and also define their leaders. Every group can have an unlimited amount of leaders.

### Advanced

Here you can define general settings like number of failed login-tries, bantime, currency, etc.

### Database

Some maintenance tasks (like a backup before updating) of the database can be done via Kimai.
